### me
I am CanftIn. This nickname maybe means 'can feature in'.
I am C++ enthusiasts, tech enthusiasts. Although knowledge I knew is shallow, I am on my way. Without prejudice against technology, also not good at arguing.
I like researching on tech frameworks and work on open source technologies. I publish my ideas and findings on my blog.
